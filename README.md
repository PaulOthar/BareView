# BareView
BareView Engine is a minimalist 3D engine designed for creating portable demonstrations within HTML pages, offering a low-level approach to 3D rendering. Unlike commercial engines, BareView requires developers to work directly with memory, providing an opportunity to explore and manipulate graphics at a granular level.
